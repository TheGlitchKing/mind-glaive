# January 2026 Sessions

## Week 1 (Jan 1-7) - Foundation & Planning

**Focus Areas**:
- Project structure and architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Development environment setup
- Initial database schema planning

**Key Decisions**:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (vs. MongoDB for flexibility, PostgreSQL for ACID guarantees)
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI with async/await (vs. Django for simplicity, FastAPI for performance)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (vs. Vue.js for team familiarity)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (vs. Tailwind for component encapsulation)
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Vitest for frontend

**Patterns Identified**:
- API endpoint design pattern (rate limiting + validation + error handling) - appearing in design discussions

**Blockers**:
- None this week

**Learnings**:
- Async/await has learning curve but worth it for I/O-bound operations
- TypeScript setup requires careful tsconfig.json configuration

## Week 2 (Jan 8-14) - Core Implementation

**Focus Areas**:
- User authentication system
- Database migrations with Alembic
- API endpoint scaffolding
- Component library setup

**Key Decisions**:
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry + 7-day refresh tokens (vs. session-based for stateless scalability)
- **Password Storage**: bcrypt with 12 rounds (vs. argon2, bcrypt more widely supported)
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic with auto-generate disabled for safety (vs. auto-generate for speed)
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based directory structure with feature/common/layout subdirs
- **API Versioning**: URL prefix approach (/api/v1/) rather than header-based

**Patterns Identified**:
- **API Endpoint Pattern** (3+ occurrences): All endpoints must include rate limiting + Pydantic validation + consistent error responses
- Database soft delete pattern emerging (2 occurrences, monitoring)
- Component composition pattern with props drilling (2 occurrences, investigating alternatives)

**Blockers Resolved**:
- Initial Alembic migration syntax errors → Reviewed official docs, created migration templates
- Async/await context in SQLAlchemy → Used async-sqlalchemy and proper session management
- TypeScript type issues with API responses → Created shared types in @/types directory

**Learnings**:
- Alembic auto-generate can introduce subtle bugs - manual review essential
- JWT refresh token strategy prevents frequent re-authentication without exposing long-lived tokens
- React useCallback dependency arrays require careful management
- Database indexes on foreign keys dramatically improve query performance

## Week 3 (Jan 15-21) - Scaling & Optimization

**Focus Areas**:
- User permissions and authorization
- Advanced database queries and optimization
- Performance profiling
- CI/CD pipeline setup

**Key Decisions**:
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenant isolation (vs. app-level auth)
- **Query Optimization**: Eager loading with joinedload/selectinload rather than lazy loading
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and automated deployments
- **Logging**: Structured logging with JSON output for production observability
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for exception monitoring

**Patterns Confirmed**:
- **API Endpoint Pattern** (5th, 6th occurrences): Rate limiting, validation, standard error format confirmed as critical pattern
- **Database Soft Delete Pattern** (4th occurrence): Confirmed as team standard across all entities
- React component composition with context API for state management (3 occurrences, confirming pattern)

**Auto-Generated Rule**:
- Created `.claude/rules/backend/api-standards.md` based on API endpoint pattern (5 occurrences)
- Created `.claude/rules/backend/database-patterns.md` based on soft delete pattern (4 occurrences)

**Blockers Resolved**:
- RLS (Row Level Security) complexity → Documentation and step-by-step implementation guide created
- Circular imports in SQLAlchemy relationships → Used TYPE_CHECKING and forward references

**Learnings**:
- PostgreSQL RLS provides strong security boundaries for multi-tenant systems
- Structured logging dramatically improves production debugging
- GitHub Actions caching significantly speeds up CI/CD runs
- Component testing gets complex with context providers - need separate test setup

**Performance Improvements**:
- Database query time: 800ms → 120ms (with proper eager loading)
- Component re-render count: Reduced by 65% with React.memo and useCallback
